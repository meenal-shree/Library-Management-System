# Blood Bank Management System

## Project Description

The main of the project was to design a Command Line Interface (CLI) for the librarian in keeping and maintaining the record of books in the library. This is done with the help of python and mongoDB. What I have implemented is a command line interface where the user can interact and perform various actions such as adding a book, listing all the books, updating a book and deleting a book. The updation abd deletion is done based on the ISBN of the book. The program keeps running until the user wants to exit the program.
